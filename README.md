<ul>
  <li>The aim of this project is to build a Machine Learning model which will predict Median Value of housing prices of California using the california census data. the data has a metrics such as population, median income, median housing prices and so on. The model able to predict the prices with RMSE - 47K. this Project Also Consist of Various Machine Learning Pipelines and Algorithms include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines Regressor, Random Forest, etc </li></ul>
